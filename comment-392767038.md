# `Optimization`

Once you've mastered the Derivatives, you would know the `optimization problems` are easy.
It's just a progress to get **the Maximum or Minimum points of a given function.** 

### `Example: Max product`

Solve:
- It's bit tricky to understand the question.
- Form a function: `P(x) = x(a-x) = ax - x²`
- To get a maximum, need to find the critical points first.
- Set `P'(x) = 0` then get `x = a/2`.
- To perform a 2nd Derivative Test: `P''(x) = -2`, means it's Concave Down
- So the critical point `a/2` is a maximum.

### `Example: Largest Area of Trapezoid Inscribed in a Semicircle`
Q: What is the area of the largest trapezoid that can be inscribed in a semicircle with radius `r = 1`?

Understanding:
- For this `Trapezoid inscribed in circle` problem, you really want to draw it out before anything else.Refer to this [animated tool](https://ggbm.at/runpCeja) from Geogebra that I created for this problem.
- Remember that a `trapezoid` has to have **TWO BASES** to be parallel.
- Know that, a `quadrilateral` CAN be inscribed in a circle or even a semicircle, which means 4 vertices  are all on the circle. 
- **A trapezoid of maximum area inscribed in the semicircle will have its base on the X-axis.** Which means the length of `bottom base` should be twice radius: `b₁ = 2·r`
- Since it's a `trapezoid`, and inscribed in a circle, then **IT HAS TO BE A ISOSCELES TRAPEZOID.** And it means it's absolute **symmetric** about the X-axis.
- With knowing all these conditions above, you could start to abstract the information into equations.
- Get some clue from the result first, then see what's missing and find a way to get it.

Solve:
- First form the equation of trapezoid's area: `A = 1/2 · (b₁+b₂) · h`
- `b₁` is the bottom base, which is equal to `2r = 2`, because the largest-area-trapezoid inscribed in circle MUST:
    - lay its base on X-axis
    - equal to the Diameter (because it's the longest base's length)
    - symmetric about the Y-axis (because two bases are parallel)
- Assume one of the `vertex` on the Top base is `(x, y)`.
- Since the two bases are parallel, so the Top Base is symmetric as well, means it has equal distance to both sides' vertices, which could conclude that:
    - The other `vertex` on the Top base should be`(-x, y)`.
    - The length of Top Base should be `b₂ = x - (-x) = 2x`
- The `h` is hight of the trapezoid, which is equal to the top vertex's `y` value.
- So the equation then becomes: `A = 1/2 · (2r + 2x) · y`.
- We need to form a function as `Area in term of x`, means the Area would change with the change of `x`. So the `y` has to transform to the term of `x`.
- Since `(x, y)` is a point of the circle, so the circle's `Standard formula` should work: `x² + y² = r²`
- Then we get: `y = √(r²-x²) = √(1-x²)`
- So the final function looks like this: `A(x) = 1/2 · (2r + 2x) · √(r²-x²) = (1+x)·√(1-x²)`
- Back to the beginning, since we are to find the largest area, so it's saying we are to find the Maximum value of the function `A(x)`.
- Set `A'(x) = 0` to find the critical point first. After solve the first derivative by applying product rule, we get: `x=-1 or 1/2`.
- Since `x` is a length, so it's a positive value, so `x = 1/2`. Then `y = √(1-x²) = √3/2`
- Do the `Second derivative test` to make sure it's a maximum: `A''(x) < 0`.
- Substitute the values back to the area equation, we get `A = 3√3 / 4`

Solve:
- Assume the area of the inside rectangle (the texts) is `T = w · h = 150`
- So the area of paper should be `A = (w+2)·(h+3)`
- Let `h = T/w = 150/w`
- So the function of area should be `A(w) = (w+2)·(150/w +3)`
- For getting the area's smallest value, we need to find the critical points first:
- Set `A'(w) = 0`, and differentiate the function to get: `A'(w) = 3 - 300/w²`, and `w=10`.
- Substitute the value back to get `h=15`, So the paper should be `(10+2) wide, and (15+3) high`.

Solve:
- Form the equation of area of the rectangle: `A = w · h`
- Apply the `Similar triangle` property from Geometry lessons, telling that the ratio between two sides are the same with its similar triangle's. So use any of the small triangle there, to form the equation: `h/(8-w) = 10/8`.
- And we make `h = 5(8-w)/4`, and the area equation then be `A(w) = 5/4 (8w - w²)`
