# `nth Term Test`
> It's also called the `nth term divergence test`.
The test can only tell if the series is divergent or not. It CAN NOT tell if it converges.

â–¼Here is the divergent test, very simple:

Solve:
- Take the limit of the `nth term` we get that the `limit = 0`.
- According to `divergent test` rules, we can't conclude anything about it.
