> Existence theorems includes 3 theorems: `Intermediate Value Theorem`, `Extreme Value Theorem`, `Mean Value Theorem`.

## `Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)`
The IVT is saying:
> When we have 2 points **connected** by a **continuous** curve:
one point **below** the line, the other point **above** the line,
then there will be at least one place where the curve crosses the line!

### Find roots by using IVT
`IVT` is often to find `roots` of a function, which means to find the `x value when f(x)=0`.
So for finding a root, the definition will be:
> If `f(x)` is continuous and has an interval `[a, b]`, which leads the function that `f(a)<0 & f(b)>0` , then it MUST has a point `f(c)=0` between interval `[a,b]`, which makes a root `c`.

### Example
Tell whether the function `f(x) = xÂ² - x - 12` in interval `[3,5]` has a root.
Solve:
- We got that at both sides of intervals: `f(3)=-6 < 0`, and `f(5)=8 > 0`
- So according to the Intermediate Value Theorem, there IS a root between `[3,5]`.
- Calculate `f(c)=0` get the root `c=4`.

## `Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)`
The EVT is saying:
> There **MUST BE** a **`Max & Min`** value,
if the function is continuous over the closed interval.

## `Mean Value Theorem (MVT)`

[Refer to Khan academy article: Establishing differentiability for MVT](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-existence-theorems/modal/a/review-establishing-differentiability-for-mvt)

The MVT is saying: 
> There **MUST BE** a `tangent line` that has the same slope with the `Secant line`,
if the function is **CONTINUOUS** over `[a,b]` and **DIFFERENTIABLE** over `(a,b)`.

Which also means that, if the conditions are satisfied, then there **MUST BE** a number `c` makes the **derivative** is equal to the **`Average Rate of Change`** between the two end points.

Conditions for applying MVT:
- Continuous over interval `(a, b)`
- Differentiable over interval `[a, b]`
