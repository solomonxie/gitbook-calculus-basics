# `Indefinite integrals` = `Antiderivatives`
> That's easier being said, **THE ANTIDERIVATIVES IS THE INDEFINITE INTEGRALS.**

Let's make it more intuitive (might not be accurate but good for learning):

- **`Antiderivatives`** is the **RESULT**.
- **`Indefinite integrals`** is the **OPERATION**.

(They're saying the same thing)

And, just for refreshing:
- **`Anti-derivatives`**: Means the **Original function** where the derivative is from.
- **`Indefinite integrals`**: **Indefinite**  means `not-defined`,  means both **BOUNDARIES** are not defined. That's why the **symbol** is without any number but `ʃ` alone.

## Why is the Indefinite Integral so confusing
It's a simple reason: 
**Because they use the `f(x)` in the Integral expression, but actually it means `f'(x)`!**

You all know the expression of indefinite integral is `ʃ f(x) dx`, But actually it should be `ʃ f'(x) dx`, which means the function appears in the middle is a derivative, from somewhere.
And the **mission** of that integral, is to find the `f(x)` the original function of the derivative!

So trust me, the world would be much nicer if you always see it as the expression as below:

## Why is Antiderivative so confusing too
Because your first impression of the antiderivative is that `is it anti- something?`
`Anti-` is a reverse, `derivative` is also a transform of something, so putting them together is really a horrible idea because it seems leading to nowhere.

Now here is the mojo, things would be much nicer if you see and call an `antiderivative` as:
**The original function `f(x)`**

It may not be accurate, but good enough to proceed to next stage of study.

## Review of Antiderivatives
> Before you proceed to the next, you really want figure out completely what an `antiderivative` means with respect to the `Integration`.

Here are a few examples to quick review what is antiderivative:

## How to understand this reverse process

Doing an `Integration`, is actually to find the `antiderivative`.

At the example below, you will find it makes so much sense if you **FIX YOUR EYES** only onto the **MIDDLE** part of the integration formula, the part between `ʃ` & `d/dx`.

Solve:
- First need to clear your mind, in this case:
    - The antiderivative is the "original function" `f(x)` we have learned.
    - The function `f(x)` here is actually the derivative, which is `f'(x)` we've learned.
- Just think it as matching function and its derivative, everything will be tackled real quick.

Solve:
- First need to make sense of the terms:
    - The function appears in the `Integral` expression, is actually the `derivative`
    - The "result" is just the `Original function` where the derivative comes from, or you could call the result is the antiderivative.
- Just think it as matching function and its derivative, everything will be tackled real quick.
