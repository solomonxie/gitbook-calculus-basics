# `Chain Rule`
> One of the **core principles** in Calculus is the Chain Rule.

It tells us how to differentiate `Composite functions`.

**It must be composite functions, and it has to have `inner & outer` functions, which you could write in form of `f(g(x))`.**

### Common mistakes
- Not recognizing whether a function is composite or not
- Wrong identification of the inner and outer function
- **Forgetting to multiply by the derivative of the inner function**
- Computing `f(g(x))` wrongly:

### How to identify Composite functions
> Seems a basic algebra101, but actually a quite tricky one to identify.

[Refer to Khan lecture: Identifying composite functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivative-rules/modal/v/recognizing-compositions-of-functions)

The core principle to identify it, is trying to re-write the function into a nested one: `f(g(x))`. If you could do this, it's composite, if not, then it's not one.

### Examples

It's a composite function, which the inner is `cos(x)` and outer is `x²`.

It's a composite function, which the inner is `2x³-4x` and outer is `sin(x)`.

It's a composite function, which the inner is `cos(x)` and outer is `√(x)`.

## `Two forms of Chain Rule`

The general form of Chain Rule is like this:

But the Chain Rule has another **more commonly used** form:

Their results are exactly the same.
It's just some people find the first form makes sense, some more people find the second one does.

Solve:
- Apply the `Log power rule` to simplify the exponential function:

- Differentiate both sides:
