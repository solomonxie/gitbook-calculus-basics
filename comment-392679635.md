# Analyze Function Behaviors with Derivatives
Analyzing function's behaviors is one of the Core Purposes of studying Calculus.

> **AND THE CORE PURPOSE OF ANALYZING FUNCTION, IS FOR COMPUTER TO UNDERSTAND IT `"BLINDLY"`, OR SAY "ALGEBRAICALLY"! BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE LIKE HUMAN TO "EYE BALL" IT!**

`First Derivative`
- Function has `critical points` when `f'(x) = 0`
- Function has `relative extrema` when `f'(x) crosses X-axis`:
    - It has `relative maxima` when `f'(x)` crosses **UP**.
    - It has `relative minima` when `f'(x)` crosses **DOWN**.

`Second Derivative`
- Function has `inflection points` when `f''(x)=0` and `f''(x)` **crosses** X-axis.
- It's `concave up` if `f''(x) > 0`
- It's `concave down` if `f''(x) < 0`

`1st & 2nd Derivative`
- It has a `relative maximum` when `f'(x)=0` & `f''(x) < 0`
- It has a `relative minimum` when `f'(x)=0` & `f''(x) > 0`
- It has an `inflection point` when `f'(x)` changes direction, **OR** `f''(x)` changes sign.
- It has a possible `inflection point` when `f'(x) = 0` & `f''(x) = 0`.
