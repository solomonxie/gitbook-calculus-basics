# `Lagrange Error Bound`
> It's also called the **`Lagrange Error Theorem`**, or **`Taylor's Remainder Theorem`**.

To approximate a function more precisely, we'd like to express the function as a **sum of a Taylor Polynomial & a Remainder.**

(▲ For `T` is the **Taylor polynomial** with n terms, and `R` is the **Remainder** after n terms.)

The tricky part of that expression is to "preset" the accuracy of the `Error`, aka. the `Remainder`.

For **bounding** the `Error`, out strategy is to apply the `Lagrange Error Bound` theorem.

Simply saying, the theorem is:
- If a function's **ALL DERIVATIVES** are bounded by **a number** over the interval `(C, x)`:

(▲ for `C` is the centre of approximation)
- where the max value of **all derivatives** of the function is:

(▲ for `z` is any value between `C` and `x` makes the derivative to the **max**)
(▲ and note that: the **input** has to be `n+1` )
- then the **function's Remainder** MUST satisfy this theorem:

### Example

Solve:
- This problem is to approximate a function with Taylor Polynomial.
- To do so, we're to set use the `Error estimation` method, which first to set up the equation:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42279513-9350909c-7fd0-11e8-8d3c-8ebf088665c5.png)
- In this case, it is:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42279412-4700f1c8-7fd0-11e8-9e21-0b07de93cd0e.png)
- Since it's only asking for the `error bound`, so we **only focus** on the Error `Rn`.
- We want to apply the `Lagrange Error Bound Theorem`, and bound it to `0.001`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42279497-859ddc34-7fd0-11e8-9b29-467cc3253085.png)
- For those **unknowns** variables in the theorem, we know that:
    - The approximation is centred at `1.5π`, so `C = 1.5π`.
    - The input of function is `1.3π`, so `x = 1.3π`.
    - For The `M` value, because **all the derivatives** of the function `cos(x)`, are bounded to 1 even **without an interval** , so let's say the max value `M = 1`.
- Therefore, the formula of this theorem becomes:

- Unfortunately, at this moment we don't have easier method to solve for `n` except trying some numbers in:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42279842-a358b0cc-7fd1-11e8-94a4-c6d8697412fa.png)
- We could see that, with the degree gets larger and larger, the `Error` becomes smaller and smaller.
- Only until `n=4`, which means the `4th derivative`, the `Error` is less than `0.001`.
- So the answer is `4th derivative`.

Solve:
- Same with the problem above, we want to apply the `Lagrange Error Bound Theorem`, and bound it to `0.001`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42279497-859ddc34-7fd0-11e8-9b29-467cc3253085.png)
- For those **unknowns** variables in the theorem, we know that:
    - The approximation is centred at `0` because it's told as a `Maclaurin Series` , so `C = 0`.
    - The input of function is `-0.95`, so `x = -0.95`.
    - The interval is (C, x) or (x, C), which is `(-0.95, 0)`  in this case.
- For The `M` value, since all the derivatives of `eˣ` is just `eˣ`, and `eˣ`  is unbounded at all, so we're to examine the Max value over the interval `(-0.95, 0)`
- With the help from `Desmos Calculator`, we know that over the interval `(-0.95, 0)`, the max value of `eˣ` is `e⁰ = 1`:

- So boundary is `M = 1`.
- Therefore, the formula of this theorem becomes:

- In this case, we need to try some numbers for `n` to get the desired value:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42286050-1b676380-7fe4-11e8-8f84-ecb0c91da588.png)
- After tried `n=5` and `n=6`, we could see that only until `n=6`, which means the `6th derivative`, the `Error` is less than `0.001`.
- So the answer is `6th derivative`.

Solve:
- Same with the problem above, we want to apply the `Lagrange Error Bound Theorem`, and bound it to `0.001`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42279497-859ddc34-7fd0-11e8-9b29-467cc3253085.png)
- For those **unknowns** variables in the theorem, we know that:
    - The approximation is centred at `2`, so `C = 2`.
    - The input of function is `2.5`, so `x = 2.5`.
    - The interval then is `(2, 2.5)`.
- For the `M` value, it's not easy to figure out, but we've been told the formula for derivative.

- So the expression for `M` would be:
- Let's directly plug in the `M` expression into the Remainder:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/42289216-e1d10362-7ff0-11e8-970e-6cff6b9c507f.png)
- With the help from `Desmos grapher` we know that when within the interval `2≤ z ≤ 2.5`, that `z=2` makes the formula to the max:

- So let's set the inequality:

- After trying out some number for `n`, we get that `n ≥ 3`.
