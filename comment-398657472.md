# `Area of Polar Curves` (Integral Calc)
Calculating area for `polar curves`, means we're now under the `Polar Coordinate` to do integration.
And instead of using `rectangles`  to calculate the area, we are to use `triangles` to integrate the area for a curve.

There're a few notable differences for calculating `Area of Polar Curves`:
- It's now under the **`Polar Coordinate`**.
- It's using **`Circle Sectors`** with infinite small angles to integral the area.
- It's the area between the function graph and a **`RAY`** or two **`RAYS`** from the origin.

## `Finding the right boundaries`
> The most tricky part in Polar system, is finding the right boundaries for `θ`, and it will be the first step for polar integral as well.

Why is this?

### Example
Find out the boundaries of θ for integrating the shaded area:

Solve:

### Example
Find out the boundaries of θ for both of the polar curves:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/46199589-068d9500-c342-11e8-832f-918c211eb631.png)
Solve:
- Obviously, for the shading area, both of the curves start at `θ = 0` and end at intersection `θ = π/6`


### Example
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/46199919-db577580-c342-11e8-9b75-e1be7ad4e321.png)
Solve:
- Start thinking as we're drawing the graph: the `r` starts drawing at 0, all the way **down** for a round and goes back to 0.
- Since it goes **counter-clockwise**, so it's obvious `r` goes from `π` then takes a round back to `2π`.
- So the boundaries are `π and 2π`

### Example
Find out the boundaries of θ for integrating the shaded area:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/46197840-806f4f80-c33d-11e8-80c0-5974b12ee8fc.png)
Solve:
- Let's look at the **drawing track**: It starts at `r = -1` ends at `r = 0`.
- So we're to find out the θ-value for the start of `r` and end of `r`:
    - When `r = -1`, from the equation we get `θ = 0`
    - When `r = 0`, from the equation we get `θ = π/3`
- Therefore, the boundaries are:

### Example
Find out the boundaries of θ for integrating the shaded area:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/46196797-93cceb80-c33a-11e8-917f-dc805766a4ed.png)
Solve:
- Notice that, for the range `θ ∋ [0,π]`, it makes `r` negative: `sin(π)-1 = -1` and `sin(0)-1 = -1`.
- But in this case, `r` starts at 0 and ends at 0, not negative value, 
- so we're gonna **despise** the given range, and compute the θ-value for `r=0`:

- And the boundaries for θ is `π/6` and `5π/6`.



## `Area between two Polar Curves`


### Example
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/41647586-5740493a-74a9-11e8-9024-236434d97861.png)
Solve:
- First to notice, the boundaries are at two function's intersects.
- So let `3sinθ = 1+sinθ`, to get `θ = π/6 and 5π/6`, which are the boundaries.
- Within the boundaries, the area asked could be calculated by subtracting the smaller area form bigger one.
- So the area is:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/41647828-f1be1118-74a9-11e8-9b3d-92282a59bae0.png)



### Example

Solve:
- It's bit tricky to find the boundaries.
- In this case, it's **not subtracting** one area from another, but **adding two small areas**:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/41649970-7bfc2784-74af-11e8-84f9-30f5b52d7e66.png)
- As showed above, for the `cosθ` shape, its boundaries are same with Quadrant-1: `[0, π/2]`
- For the `1+sinθ` shape, its boundaries are same with Quadrant-4: `[3π/2, 2π]`
- So the shaded region is:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/41650221-1a691436-74b0-11e8-86ec-397a7541f0ed.png)


### Example

Solve:
- Another tricky one to **combine** areas.
- Figure out the combination areas as below:

- So the total area is:
