> Calculating `Favg` is just to get the actual area of the function, 
and then "reform" it to a rectangle, 
then divide it by its width, then you get the height.

Strategy:
- Calculate the function's `integral`, which is the `Actual area of the function`
- Calculate the `Interval`, which is the `imaginary rectangle's width`.
- Divide the area by width to get the `Average value of function`, which is the height.


## `Mean value theorem for integrals`
> It actually IS the `Average Value of Functions`
