# `Motion problems (Differential calc)`

`Motion Problems` are all about this relationships: 
`Moving position -> Velocity(or speed) -> Acceleration`.

These terms are constantly confusing people, especially the follow parts:
- Velocity is NOT the derivative of speed, but only the speed with a direction: `s(t) = |v(t)|`.
- Velocity IS the **derivative** of Position: `v(t) = p'(t)`
- Acceleration is the **derivative** of the Velocity: `a(t) = v'(t)`
- Max or Min Position means `Velocity = v(t) = p'(t) = 0`
- Max or Min Velocity means `Acceleration = a(t) = v'(t) = 0`
- Max or Min Acceleration means `a'(t) = v''(t) = p'''(t) = 0`

Solve:
- The tricky part here is the relationships: `Position -> Velocity -> Acceleration`
    - Position:  `p(t) = x(t)`
    - Velocity: `v(t) = x'(t)`
    - Acceleration: `a(t) = v'(t) = x''(t)`
- To conclude, the Max velocity should satisfy this: `a(t) = 0` & `a'(t) < 0`
- Differentiate `x(t)` twice and set `x''(t) = 0`, get `t = 1`.

Solve:
- The velocity is `v(t) = x'(t)`
- The Acceleration is `a(t) = v'(t) = x''(t) = 0`, and get `t=1`
- Substitute to `v(1) = 3`
